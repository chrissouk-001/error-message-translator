## About Security

Since this is a research testing project, we keep security procedures simple:

* Found a security issue? Just let us know!
* Email: [csoukoulis.tech@gmail.com](mailto:csoukoulis.tech@gmail.com)
* Include what you found and how to reproduce it
* We'll look into it when we can

This is not a production application, so while we appreciate security reports, our response times and processes are informal.

Thank you for participating in this research project!
